BlocJams is one of my earliest web develprojects and my first working with AngularJS. Although I started this project by following a tutorial, by the end I was implementing my own solutions and improvising small features to make the user experience flow better. I love BlocJams because it stands as playground of sorts, offering a stable base that I can experiment on and practice improving.
