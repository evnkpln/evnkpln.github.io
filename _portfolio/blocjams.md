short-description: BlocJams for iOS is awesome!

BlocJams is one of my earliest web development projects and my first working with AngularJS. Although I started this project by following a tutorial, by the end I was implementing my own solutions and improvising small features to make the user experience flow better. I love BlocJams because it stands as a playground of sorts, offering a stable base that I can experiment on and practice making incremental improvements on.

BlocJams started as a basic web app, using only the jQuery library. Making the conversion to the opinionated Angular framework brought a lot of baggage with it; requiring a great deal of refactoring, relearning, and a careful attention to scope. The process payed off significantly, though. While Angular did not enable any new functionality per se, it did simplify process the considerably. In many cases, several lines of DOM manipulation code could be replicated with a singular angular directive. Condensing code into more intuitive, simple options in this way freed up brain space to tackle more complicated challenges.

Having Angular in my toolkit is an incredibly useful consequence of this project, but the real lesson came within the refactoring process itself. I now know to be on the lookout during future projects for these powerful tools. Finding the right one for the job and shaving down the complexity of the code can truly enable faster and more impressive results.
