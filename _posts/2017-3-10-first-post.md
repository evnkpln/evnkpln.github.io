Hello and welcome to my personal web development journey. I'll be using this blog to document my process learning and working in web development and probably other loosely related topics as well. Today I'd like to share a bit about how I came to this field and where I'd like to go with it.

I've always tried to approach the challenges and goals of life holistically, wielding critical thinking and artistic interpretation together to arrive at something greater. This most obviously manifested itself in my seemingly disparate passions for acting and computer programming. As I was forced to choose between them I found myself vacillating, first earning my degree for Computer Science and later studying and pursuing an acting career.

Flash forward to present day as I approach Bloc's web-developer bootcamp; I find myself returning to this holistic idea. From a purely technical standpoint, my goal is to leverage the more theoretical CS concepts I learned in college into something more practical and modern. However, I'm also looking to temper this process with some form of artistic purpose.

I don't yet know what form this multidisciplinary beast will take, but I know that I've been tracking it all my life. It may have some machine learning dna, likely some game design, but that's not especially important right now. In my experience,  the direction itself is less important than the simple act of stepping towards something. I intend to learn by doing, and I'm confident that any new experience I find will contribute to my perspective.
