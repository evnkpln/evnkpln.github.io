title: Healing the Political Divide- part 2
---
In my [last post](insertlinktoposthere) I outlined an issue of a growing divide in US politics and the role of technology within it. Today I am going to sketch out some ideas for web apps aimed at addressing this issue.

A primary challenge in fostering discourse between hostile parties is a lack of shared language. A quick perusal of [partisan](http://occupydemocrats.com/) news [websites](http://www.redstate.com/) reveals that articles are adressed directly to their base. These articles take for granted that anyone reading it will harbor certain opinions and will be familiar with certain partisan ideologies, thus using a shorthand to refer to them and skipping justifications of potentially controversial ideas. This also tends to create a shared vocabularly that may be either incomprehensible or inflammatory to readers on the other side of the field.

In order to communicate effectively with each other, we're going to need to build a language and communication that we can share. I have a few ideas of how to approach this task: two of them stemming from familiar structures and one a bit novel.

The first implementation would be the simplest: a forum. This idea would be little more than an effort to sketch out a space for discussion.  What would differentiate it somewhat would be it's form of moderation. Users would need to make a commitment upfront towards guiding principles of cooperation, and moderators would be selected from each side of the debate to ensure productive discussion continues. A tall order, to be sure, but this straightforward, hands-off approach could potentially serve the community with minimal upkeep.

Expanding on the idea of party-based moderators: a "reach-out" news feed. This could take a short form having some simple theme like "I wish people on the other side understood -----"with curators responsible for selecting representative posts of their sides platform. I would be more interested in something a bit more expansive, soliciting long-form opinion pieces and potentially hiring dedicated writers. Either way, such a site would only be as good as its content.

Then there's something a little more out there. I've given this project the working title of "Consensus". Consensus would be a polling based tool designed to seek-out and highlight common beliefs and goals between sharply divided communities. This idea is more complicated than the others, so I'll be giving it its own blog post soon.
